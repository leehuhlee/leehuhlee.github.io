## 1. Introduce

# Star Gate
The number of passengers on domestic flights was about 61 million in 2015 to about 90 million in 2019. It has increased about 1.5 times in four years. As the number of people on board increases,the number of people who experience inconvenience in the process of checking their luggage is also increasing. Anyone who has ever used an airplane must have had the experience of carrying things on board and throwing them away just before boarding the plane. In order to avoid this experience, existing airplane passengers wanted to determine whether certain items should be allowed into the aircraft during carrier packing process. To do so, they had to first come up with keywords for the item, then go to a website that offered related services and search for permission. There was inconvenience in going through these two processes, and there were also many items that did not appear in the keyword search. To eliminate this inconvenience, we created an application that tells us whether the item can be brought into the plane through object recognition technology.
