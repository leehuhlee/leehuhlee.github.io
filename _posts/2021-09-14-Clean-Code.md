# Foreword
* Introduction
  - I write thousands of or milions of codes one day. And I proud of myself with my codes. However, in several days, I get rid of those codes and rewrite, because I cannot sure this is clean code. Duplicating this work, I can refactorize my codes, as a result, there leaves only requirements. Moreover, it helps our maintainment. But, it needs cost of time and effor. This book is not a solution, but, through Clean Code, I can listen experts' opinions, reorganize my code style, and be more professional.
* Thanks to
  - Benjamin Nuske, who is CEO of Delta Engine GmbH, presented me this book. I really thanks to him.

# Chapter 1: Clean Code

## There will be code
  - Programming makes machine to run and the program is associated with code.
  - Abstraction of programming language is advancing.
  - Code is one of language and is requirement what we express.

## Bad Code
  - Impeding other code
  - Uncareful code
  - Unorganized Code: Later equals Never

## The total cost of owning a mess
  - One change makes two or three errors.
  - Over time the mess becomes so big and so deep.
  - And productivity approaches zero.

## The grand redesign in the sky
  - Consuming your time to make clean code is associated with effectivity and professionality.
  - Programming is a race and it can be longer.

## Attitude
  - Requirements' change make bad code.
  - Too tight schedule makes bad code.
  - It is unprofessional for programmers to bend to the will of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes.

## The primal conundrum
  - The only way to make the deadline is to keep the code as clean as possible at all times

## The art of clean code?
  - Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a myriad little techniques applied through a painstakingly acquired sense of `cleanliness`.
  - The `Code-sense` will help that programmer choose the best variation and guide him or her to plot a sequence of behavior preserving transformations to get from here to there.

## What is clean code?
  - elegant, pleasing, readable, to be enhance, easy to care, no duplication, one thing, expressiveness, tiny abstractions, beutiful

## Schools of thought
  - a clean variable name, a clean function, a clean class, etc.

## We are authors
  - Indeed, authors are responsible for communicating well with their readers.
  - So making it easy to read actually makes it easier to write.
  - If you want to go fast, if you want to get done quickly, if you want your code to be easy to write, make it easy to read.

## The boy scout rule
  - Leave the caompground cleaner than you found it.

## Prequel and principles
  - These include the Single Responsibility Principle(SRP), the Open Closed Principle(OCP), and the Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP) among others.
