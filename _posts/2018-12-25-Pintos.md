## What is Pintos?

* Training Operating System for x86 Architecture
* Made in 2004 by Stanford Ben Paff
* Support kernel threads, loading and running user programs, file systems, etc.
* Use x86 simulator such as Bochs or QEMU

## Project 1 : Execute command from command line

* Develops the ability to separate strings of command lines into tokens
  - Pintos can't distinguish between a program and a factor
  - Separate program names and factors from each other and store them in the stack
  - Pass them to the program

* Result
{% highlight vim %}
$ pintos –v -- run ‘echo x’
{% endhighlight %}

## Project 2 : Prevent data from being written to a running file
If the file data of a running user program changes, it is likely that the program will read the changed data differently from the original expected data.
If this occurs, write access to running user programs at the OS level should be prevented because the currently running program cannot produce the correct computational results.

* To solve this project
  - Need to know exactly where the file is running
  - Modifying data in running program files to prevent changes
  - A function that prevents data change is already implemented in pintos
  - Modify the data in a running file to change only when the program is terminated

* Result<br>
Path : pintos/src/userprog
{% highlight vim %}
$ make grade
{% endhighlight %}

## Project 3-1 : Scheduling

* Round Robin -> Priority<br>
Currently, the scheduler of the pintos is implemented as a round robin. Modify this scheduler to priority scheduling
  - Time Quantum: 40 msec (src/thread.c)
  - If the new thread added to the Ready list is higher than the current one, push out the existing thread and allow it to occupy the CPU
  - When multiple threads wait to get lock, semaphore, the highest priority thread takes over the CPU

* Result<br>
{% highlight vim %}
$ make check
{% endhighlight %}

## Project 3-2 : Scheduling

* Priority Inversion
  - Implement Priority Donation
  - Implement Multiple Donation
  - Implement Nested Donation

* Multiple Donation<br>
If more than one thread has more than one lock, a donation may occur by each lock.
  - Remember the priority of the previous state

</figure>

## Project 3-3 : Scheduling

* Implement Multi-Level Feedback Queue Scheduler
  - Priority

* Priority
  - The larger the number, the higher the priority
  - Initialize when creating threads (default : 31)
  - All thread : Recalculate priority every second<br>
  $$
\begin{align*}
 priority = PRI_(MAX) – (recent_(cpu) / 4) – (nice * 2)
\end{align*}
$$
  - Current thread : Preference recalculation for every 4 clock tick (using formula below)
  - 1 tick is 10 msec (src/thread.c)
