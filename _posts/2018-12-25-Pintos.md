## What is Pintos?

* Training Operating System for x86 Architecture
* Made in 2004 by Stanford Ben Paff
* Support kernel threads, loading and running user programs, file systems, etc.
* Use x86 simulator such as Bochs or QEMU

## Project 1 : Execute command from command line

* Develops the ability to separate strings of command lines into tokens
  - Pintos can't distinguish between a program and a factor
  - Separate program names and factors from each other and store them in the stack
  - Pass them to the program

* Result
{% highlight vim %}
$pintos –v -- run ‘echo x’
{% endhighlight %}

## Project 2 : Prevent data from being written to a running file
If the file data of a running user program changes, it is likely that the program will read the changed data differently from the original expected data.
If this occurs, write access to running user programs at the OS level should be prevented because the currently running program cannot produce the correct computational results.

* To solve this project
  - Need to know exactly where the file is running
  - Modifying data in running program files to prevent changes
  - A function that prevents data change is already implemented in pintos
  - Modify the data in a running file to change only when the program is terminated

* Result
Path : pintos/src/userprog
{% highlight vim %}
$make grade
{% endhighlight %}
