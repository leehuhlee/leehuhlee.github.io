## What is Pintos?

* Training Operating System for x86 Architecture
* Made in 2004 by Stanford Ben Paff
* Support kernel threads, loading and running user programs, file systems, etc.
* Use x86 simulator such as Bochs or QEMU

## Project 1 : Execute command from command line

* Develops the ability to separate strings of command lines into tokens
  - Pintos can't distinguish between a program and a factor
  - Separate program names and factors from each other and store them in the stack; pass them to the program

* Result
{% highlight vim %}
$pintos –v -- run ‘echo x’
